1. Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName ApplicationDbContext -MigrationsDirectory Migrations\ApplicationDbContext -Force
	This command would generate the initialCreate that can create the same database as the current database which is created by Code First
	before enabling migration, i.e. Code First can automatically create the database according to the model code when the project is running.
	If there is not yet the database created by Code First, i.e. the project has not been run, Enable-Migration will not create initialCreate.
	But a migration containing the same code as initialCreate will be created if executing Add-Migration after Enable-Migration.

2. Change seed() in Migrations/ApplicationDbContext/Configuration.cs to set the initial states of tables
3. (Optional)Add-Migration migrationName -ConfigurationTypeName MVCMovie.Migrations.ApplicationDbContext.Configuration
	This command is intended to create a migration for the model change in code since last migration was created.
4. Update-Database -ConfigurationTypeName MVCMovie.Migrations.ApplicationDbContext.Configuration
	This command will execute all pending migrations, and then the seed method

Summary:
Basically migration is intended to match the database with the code changes. As a result, it is used after there is some model change.
